# Collab 2024 - The Goblin Menace
A map for Dungeon Siege LoA.

_Journey through five different lands made by five different modders and defeat the Blasted Goblin!_

This map was created as a collaboration project on the Kingdom of Ehb Discord in 2024.\
Each collaborator created a part of the map, which were then stitched together.

## _Chapter I: The Ancient Valley_ by Eksevis
_The crypt collapsed behind you, now there's no going back. It doesn't take long for you to realize something is going wrong_

About me: This is my first released maps, and although I can be _""somewhat""_ stubborn about things, I have learned an immense amount working on the first slice. As far as things I have published; several textures and models in several mods, including Consistent Textures --the most notable-- and several assets in other campaigns by Firstie.

About my contribution: I started with the "valley town", not really having any specific plans for it, but when we started talking about actually putting our heads together to make this, I decided to push what I had for the collaboration. Much of my slice focuses on a deep valley surrounded by high and steep cliff faces covered in ancient ruins of a nearly forgotten civilization. For at least the first half, I really wanted to depict what it feels like to explore an area well beyond its prime. Afterwards, you come to a floodplain created by two rivers running through a canyon that ends with a cave that had partially collapsed, letting the light into the darkest places.

## _Chapter II: The Path of the Merchant_ by Emir Ghanawa
_Becoming a merchant is a windy road. Especially so for the unlucky in birth._

About me: My public work currently consists of a playable map - The Eastern Kingdoms I: Neathis. To my knowledge, it's the first map at the time being allowing 8 characters in SP reach level 150. As the name suggests, I hope to create an entire franchise of maps, storywise connected. The second one is in works, already allowing to reach lvl about 130. I put many years into DS modding.

About my contribution: My part consists of 'tiger caves' (named after specific color pattern of local grass), snowy regions, frost fae lands, and finally, the ice caves. I learnt a lot of new stuff working on this collaboration, and earned particular love for quests, as you will see. I have no boundaries, and had to be told to _stop_ making quests.

## _Chapter III: Underland_ by Firstie
_Deep below the surface of the world, there lie wondrous lands where crystals and mushrooms grow..._

About me: I've been modding and map-making for several years now - my work includes maps like Pentachoron Garden, Empire of Stars and Green Range, mods like Wintermod, Halloween and the Summons Collection, as well as the GasPy script collection and the Minibits resources collection.

About my contribution: For the collab, I created a land of caves, completely underground. Once you made it through the upper layer of dirt and worms, you'll enter a layer of crystal madness, and below that lies a magical land where the Underlings live in a forest of giant mushrooms. Focus was on landscaping and worldbuilding, rather than questing or combat. I hope you like the journey through Underland - it's certainly the low-point of the collaboration!

## _Chapter IV: Shattered Crossings_ by Sadowson
_A broken bridge, an ancient curse..._

About me: I've been making mods for Dungeon Siege practically since the Siege Editor was first released back in the early 2000's, though my skills have significantly progressed since then! This has been a fun diversion from my current projects which I'm hoping to share more of in the future.

About my contribution: The hero has entered a dark valley with an even darker secret. The undead are restless and hostile mercenaries have been seen roaming around, a curious situation for an otherwise normally sleepy place. Lady Athena in her home of Larissa is seeking a solution to the problem and perhaps you are the answer?\
Shattered Crossings is a story that I've had on paper for a good long while now. Players only interested in hacking and slashing their way through enemies should find no trouble doing so, meanwhile other players that have a deeply vested interest in a storyline with hidden secrets to uncover should find a good story that unfolds before them.

## _Chapter V: The Lair of Doom_ by Andreou
_The end of the journey draws near..._

About me: I have always been a big fan of DS, and of making new stuff in general, so it was only natural for the two to collide. I've worked a lot on making new maps for DS, but haven't gotten to finishing many. Have the demo for Ethenn and a rework of veteran and elite maps balancing here on Nexus. Big project on the way, so I joined in with this awesome collaboration to make something nice for the community.

About my contribution: The last chapter is made by yours truely. Discover the lair of the evil one behind all of the misery of these lands, and find the pleasure of destroying all of it's many machines and followers. All through three huge and breath taking regions: the Sunset Slopes, Dirgnon Mines, and the volcanic lair of the Blasted Goblin himself.
